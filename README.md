[ECMA-48, Control Functions for Coded Character Sets](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-048.pdf)  
This standard covers the basic set of ANSI escape sequences.  

## Issues

Did you find a bug, or does `ansi-optmizer` not work as expected?
Please open an issue on our [GitHub] repository.

**Disclaimer:**  
Different terminal emulators interpret ANSI escape sequences differently.
While `ansi-optimizer` tries its best to produce escape sequences that behave the same on every terminal, we can't guarantee anything outside of the official standards.

## Support

**Contributing:**  
If you wish to contribute, we are accepting pull requests!
 
**Documentation:**  
To ensure that `ansi-optmizer` is correct and compatible with most terminal emulators, documentation is a must-have. If anybody is able to contribute official standards or references to the implementation details in popular terminal emulators, it would be greatly apprecaited!

We are currently missing:

- ISO 8613-6

If anybody is able to share relevant information and official standards or documentation for various ANSI codes, it would be appreciated!
